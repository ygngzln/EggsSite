This is my personal website, I just wanted to make a more professional project, instead of just using raw HTML/JS/CSS or a random numbers game on repl.it.

Uses the MERN stack.

M - MongoDB

E - ExpressJS

R - ReactJS

N - NodeJS

This is my first time using backend (ExpressJS and MongoDB). This is also my first time using a JS/HTML framework (React). I have used NodeJS many times already but still plan on expanding my knowledge.

I hope to see more of these projects in the future.
